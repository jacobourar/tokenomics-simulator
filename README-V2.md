# WOO Tokenomics Research Platform V2

## Version Information
- **Base Version**: V1 (Original WOO tokenomics model)
- **Current Version**: V2 (Enhanced model with new features)
- **Created**: 2025-01-24

## Changes from V1
This V2 model is built upon the solid foundation of V1 but includes enhanced features and mechanisms.

### V1 Foundation Features (Preserved)
- System Dynamics modeling approach
- Monthly timestep simulation
- Fee generation from WOOFi swap/perp and WOO X
- Fee distribution to affiliates, stakers, and treasury
- Auto-compound mechanism with market purchases
- Match & burn treasury mechanism
- Dual price impact model (permanent + temporary)
- Professional UI with Chart.js visualizations

### V2 Enhancements (To Be Implemented)
[This section will be populated with the new features you want to implement]

## Architecture
The V2 model maintains the same modular JavaScript architecture:
- `index.html`: Main HTML structure (updated for V2)
- `js/simulation.js`: Core simulation logic
- `js/charts.js`: Chart management
- `js/ui.js`: UI interactions
- `js/main.js`: Application coordinator
- `js/config.js`: Configuration constants
- `css/styles.css`: Custom styling

## Development Approach
1. **Preserve V1 Logic**: Core simulation flow and calculations remain as reference
2. **Incremental Enhancement**: Add new features step by step
3. **Testing**: Each change will be tested to ensure functionality
4. **Documentation**: All changes documented for transparency

## Getting Started with V2
1. Open `v2-new/index.html` in a modern web browser
2. The interface will show "V2" in the title to distinguish from V1
3. All V1 functionality is preserved while new features are being developed
